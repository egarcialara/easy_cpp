# Easy exercises to learn C++
Old memory of the exercises that my brother used to teach me code, back in 2010. They can be useful for new C++ learners.

Each script performs a simple action: 
1- sum (the vary essential sum a+b=c)
2- largest_number
3- exponential (of any number, x^y)
4- factorial (of any number, x!)
5- matrices_multiplication (MxN)
6- vowels (is your input a vowel?)
7- palindrome_finder (is your input a palindrome?)
8- pyramid (draws a pyramid in the console)

In order to use your own scripts, you should 
1) create a file 'new_script.cpp', 
2) edit the file with any text editor,
3) compile your script using e.g. g++ (in the console: $ g++ name_script.cpp -o new_program.exe More info in https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse373/99au/unix/g++.html),
4)run your program (in the console: $ ./new_program.exe)
