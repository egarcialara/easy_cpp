# Easy exercises to learn C++
Old memory of the exercises that my brother used to teach me code, back in 2010. They can be useful for new C++ learners.


Each script performs a simple action: 
* sum (the vary essential sum a+b=c)
* largest_number
* exponential (of any number, x^y)
* factorial (of any number, x!)
* matrices_multiplication (MxN)
* vowels (is your input a vowel?)
* palindrome_finder (is your input a palindrome?)
* pyramid (draws a pyramid in the console)
* seconds to hours (converts a number of seconds into the time in hours-minutes-seconds)



In order to use your own scripts, you should 
1. create a file 'new_script.cpp', 
2. edit the file with any text editor,
3. compile your script using e.g. g++ (in the console: $ g++ name_script.cpp -o new_program.exe More info in https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse373/99au/unix/g++.html),
4. run your program (in the console: $ ./new_program.exe)
